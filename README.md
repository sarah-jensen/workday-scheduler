## Using jQuery and Day.js

The purpose of this project was to practice using the Day.js library to work with date/time and use jQuery to create a simple calendar application that saves user-entered information to local storage.
I practice using $(this) to refer to elements in the DOM, and used jQuery methods to remove/add classes, and replace part of an id string in order to parse it to an integer that could be used in a conditional statement.

![A simple calendar app named "Work Day Scheduler." The current day and date is displayed at the top of the page, and a table contains rows for 9:00am through 5:00pm with space to enter a task or appointment. Each row has its own save button. Each row has its own save button. Depending on the time of day, the color of each event may be gray (for past hours), blue (for the current hour), or green (for hours in the future).](./Assets/Screenshot%202023-03-11%20181214.png)
